		<p>Sky Asylum exists to shine the light of the truth of creation and our Creator through the medium of film.</p>
	
		<p>It exists to hold a mirror up to the beauty, joy and pain of the every day; reflecting the black and white and full color of the wide spectrum of life.</p>
	
		<p>Made of a team of poets, dreamers, pirates and adventurers, Sky Asylum will continue to make quality films as long as those movies are relevant and armed with purpose.</p>
	 
		<p>Sky Asylum is defined by no one person, or one place, but rather by the King and His Kingdom.</p>
