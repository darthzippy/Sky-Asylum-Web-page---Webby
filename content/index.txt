	<h1>Welcome to<br /><span>SKY ASYLUM</span></h1>
 
	<p>We are a New England-based indie film company. Established in 2002, we have worked in features and documentaries, as well as covering special events.</p>
	
	<p>Sky Asylum are primarily story-tellers. We are a motley crew of poets, dreamers, pirates and adventurers striving to make films that are relevant and armed with purpose.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to our own productions, we have worked in association with <a href="http://www.purplec.com">Purple Crayon Productions</a> for the sci-fi noir The Present (accepted at festivals in New York and New Hampshire), and with Fox C. Flix for the crime drama Dominoes.</p>
